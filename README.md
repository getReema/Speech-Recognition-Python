# Speech-Recognition-Python
a web application that allows the user to upload a wav audio file then print out the recognized text.

In this version of "Speech Recognizer using Python", I deliver a web application built using Flask framework.
The speech recognizer is based on Speech-Recognition module that provide a google API.

To use this speech recognizer:

Navigate to the index page
After loading the index page successfully, upload a wav audio file
Click Transcript to get the transcript -recognized speech- from the uploaded file.
